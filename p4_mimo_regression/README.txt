This is the solution of problem 4. The requirement is to map inputs to the output with the minimum error. This is achieved via regression using neural netowrk (NN). 

The solution contains the implementation of a multi input and multi output regression using Pytorch.
There are three hidden layers and one input and one output layer. Relu activation function is used to learn non-linear features. Moreover, stocastic gradient decent (SGD) is used as a optimiser and mean squared error (MSE) as a loss function.

The training is done for 200 epochs with obtaining upto 113 MSE. 

The loss is ploted and shown in the given notebook.
